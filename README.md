## Frequesntly Asked Questions

### Q: IP seems to be flickering outside of a game what should I do?
- If this is happening this means there are other servers I have yet to filter within the 3 different realms (America, Europe, Asia) if this happens click Copy IP to send me a report with the IP in question to add to our list.

### Q: Can the DirectX Overlay be edited in real time?
- Yes it can but the FontFamily field may error if you try to change that while its running, I would always suggest disabling the overlay before any Font style changes.

### Q: I accidently added an IP before an SOJ was sold how do I remove it?
- Click on the IP in the list, then click the "Remove Seleceted IP" button, followed by a prompt to make sure you want to delete it from list, click "Ok" and it should remove it from the list of checked IP addresses.

### Q: How do I reset my list for new DClone hunt?
- Click the "Clear All" button followed by a prompt to make sure you want to clear the entire list, click "Ok" and it should clear all entries from the list.

### Q: Do I need to supply an IP address to use this tool?
- No you can hunt with or without an IP address provided, it just makes things easier to keep track of without an IP supplied so you can keep track of IP's you've checked already.

### Q: Why do I need to download TCPView? Can't you do what it's doing as well.
- Currently researching how to effectively replicate what TCPView is doing to remove the need for it, but for now this is the safest way to obtain the IP address without triggering any anti cheat flags connecting to the games process directly to fetch info.

### Q: Can I get banned using this tool?
- Like any third party tools, Blizzard / Battle.net holds the right to ban anyone using third party tools to gain any sort of advantage in the game.
